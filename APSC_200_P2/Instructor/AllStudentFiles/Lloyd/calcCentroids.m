function centroids = calcCentroids(agentPoints, mass, density,...
    agentPositions, partitions)
%% calcCentroids
% Calculates the centroid of each agent's observed region
%
% Parameters:
%   agentPoints
%     n-by-1 cell array, where cell i contains agent i's observed points
%   mass
%     n-by-1 vector where the ith entry is the mass of agent i's observed
%     region
%   density
%     (sides*partitions)-by-(sides*partitions) matrix of the density for
%     the current iteration
%   agentPositions
%     n-by-2 vector of the x, y positions for n agents
%   partitions
%     Number of subdivisions within each unit length of the arena
%
% Returns:
%   centroids
%     n-by-2 vector of the x, y positions of the centroids of each region
